\chapter{Conclusion}  %Title of the Conclusion
This report provides a proposal for the potential research 
activities for the following PhD. The main focus would be 
the literature review section which covers most of important 
bits of the following report. Based on the surveyed implementations 
in the literature review which is for Uni-kernels, Multi-kernels 
and TAG based architecture the identified mappings are as follows.
For Uni-kernels the best implementation of among the surveyed would be Hermit-Core, for Multi-kernels 
Popcorn linux would be a suitable choice and for TAG based architecture
CHERI would be a suitable choice. The literature review section
provides the exact reasons. The research timeline section helped
to create a focused depth of the initial milestones for the research 
activities to be conducted.
