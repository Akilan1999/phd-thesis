There has been a lot work done in the areas of slim down kernels, OS paradigms which treat a multi-core machine as network of independent cores 
and specialized hardware which could provide certain security features. While independently they have been heavily worked on. The major aims for 
the following research would be to combine all 3 of them to together and address the potential benefits from such an approach. The year 1 report 
does a survey of implementations done in the areas Uni-kernels, Multi-kernels and TAG based architectures and based on these surveys comes up
with the research aims for the following PhD. A timeline is provided to with the detailed plan for the following research.
