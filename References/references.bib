	abstract = {Embedded computing devices are used on a large scale in the emerging internet of things (IoT). However, their wide deployment raises the incentive for attackers to target these devices, as demonstrated by several recent attacks. As IoT devices are built for long service life, means are required to protect sensitive code in the presence of potential vulnerabilities, which might be discovered long after deployment. Tagged memory has been proposed as a mechanism to enforce various ﬁne-grained security policies at runtime. However, none of the existing tagged memory schemes provides efﬁcient and ﬂexible compartmentalization in terms of isolated execution environments.},

	doi = {10.1109/HPEC.2018.8547578},
	abstract = {Security for Internet-of-Things devices is an increasingly critical aspect of computer architecture, with implications that spread across a wide range of domains. We present the design and implementation of a hardware dynamic information flow tracking (DIFT) architecture for RISC-V processor cores. Our approach exhibits the following features at the architecture level. First, it supports a robust and software-programmable policy that protects bare-metal applications against memory corruption attacks such as buffer overflows and format strings, without causing false alarms when running real-world benchmarks. Second, it is fast and transparent, having a small impact on applications performances and providing a fine-grain management of security tags. Third, it consists of a flexible design that can be easily extended for targeting new sets of attacks. We implemented our architecture on PULPino, an open-source platform that supports the design of different RISC-V cores targeting IoT applications. FPGA-based experimental results show that the overall overhead is low, with no impact on the processor performance and negligible storage increase.},
