%********************************** %Introduction for literature review **************************************

The literature review is split into 3 sections. The first section talks about the papers surveyed 
for Unikernels and the 2nd section talks about papers surveyed for TAG based architectures and 
the third sections talks about the possible incentives of combining them both which helps 
answer the research questions stated (TODO: Add reference to research question section). 

\section[TAG based architecture survey]{TAG based architecture survey}   
The following was a survey conducted on exisisting TAG based implementations and the 
recent survey based on TAG based architectures (//TODO add survey reference) published
in 2022 was a good staring point to understand about various implementations of TAG
based archtectures with the high level metrits and limitations. The following section 
provides our own version of the Survey to help decide the best implementations 
to answer the research questions (//TODO reference research questions chapter). 
 
According to the TAG based architecture survey (//TODO add survey reference) there are 37 published
efforts on TAG based architectures over the past decade and 20 published efforts preceding that. 

\subsection{Timder V}
 It is a tagged memory architecture for flexible and efficient isolation of code and data on 
 small embedded systems. The TAG isolation is augmented with a memory protection unit to isolate 
 induvidual processes. Timber V is compatible with exsisting code. The contributions of the paper 
 are: 
 \begin{itemize}
  \item Efficient tagged memory architecture for isolated execution on low-end processors. 
  \item Concept introducted called stack interleaving that allows efficient and dynamic memory management. 
  \item Lightweight shared memory between enclaves. 
  \item Efficient shared MPU (i.e Memory Protection Unit) design. 
 \end{itemize}

\subsection{ARM MTE}
The ARMv8.5-Memory Tagging Extension (MTE) aims to increase the memory safety written for 
unsafe languages without requiring source code changes and in certain cases without 
recompilation. It generally foicuses on the bounds checking use case, Though it 
provides limited tags which means it can only provide probablilistic overflow detection. 
It is one of the latest commercial incarnations of memory-safety-focused tagged architectures.   

\subsection{D-RI5CY}
It provides a design a design and implementation of a hardware dynamic information flow 
tracking (DIFT) architecture for RISC-V processor cores. The paper presents a low 
overhead implementation of DIFT that is specialized for low-end embedded systems
for IOT applications. The following are high level contributions:
\begin{itemize}
  \item Design f D-RI5CY, A DIFT-protected implementation of the RI5CY processor core. 
        The paper implements the modification of the DIFT TAG propogation and TAG checking
        mechanism in a way that is transparent to the execution of the regular instructions. 
  \item Concept introducted called stack interleaving that allows efficient and dynamic memory management.
  \item Lightweight shared memory between enclaves.
  \item Efficient shared MPU (i.e Memory Protection Unit) design.
\end{itemize}
