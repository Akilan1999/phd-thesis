The increasing disparity between application workloads and the capacity of Translation Lookaside Buffers (TLB) 
has prompted researchers to explore innovative solutions to mitigate this gap. One such approach involves 
leveraging physically contiguous memory to optimize TLB utilization. Concurrently, advancements in hardware-level 
system security, exemplified by the Capability Hardware Enhanced RISC Instructions (CHERI) architecture, offer 
additional opportunities for improving memory management and security.
  
CHERI introduces capability-based addressing, a novel approach that enhances system security by associating capabilities 
with memory pointers. These capabilities restrict access to memory regions, thereby fortifying the system against various 
security threats. Importantly, the mechanisms implemented in CHERI for enforcing memory protection can also serve as 
accelerators for standard user-space memory allocators. By leveraging capability-based addressing, memory 
allocators can efficiently manage memory resources while ensuring robust security measures are in place.
