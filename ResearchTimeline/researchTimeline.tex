The following chapter talks about the research activity timeline conducted for a duration of 2 and half years. 
The plan is subject to change based on any deviation which will be attempted to be covered in the risk analysis 
section. The recent tasks are provided in depth in contrast to later tasks which will be more open ended 
as it reliant to the results from preceding tasks.

  \end{figure}

Before starting a heavy discussion of the plan and experiment a few things that should cleared out before starting would be 
the higher overview of the experiment and why certain porting efforts are required. The Segments would be classified into: 
\begin{enumerate}
  \item Porting Unikernel implementation 
  \item Porting CheriOS to a Uni-kernel
\end{enumerate}

\subsubsection{Porting Unikernel implementation}
The Uni-kernel implementation used for the following PhD would be RustyHermit 
which is Rust implementation of the Uni-kernel project Hermit-core. The reason 
RustyHermit was selected is because the Hermit-core project is deprecated and 
the recent version of the project in the RustyHermit repo. To give a better 
background the HEXO paper \cite{HEXO} which uses Popcorn Linux to offload 
tasks to a potato machine (i.e raspberry pi) which uses the HermitTux Uni-kernel (This 
is a fork for the Hermit-core Uni-kernel). The HermitTux fork of HermitCore is used to 
run Linux ABI binary files on a Uni-kernel. To ensure we can continue working with the
planned experiments. It would recommended to port HermitTux to RustyHermit to ensure we 
can sync the new version of HermitTux with the latest changes from RustyHermit. Fig ~\ref{fig:PlannerPorting}
 provides the visual description of the following paragraph. 

\subsubsection{Porting CheriOS to a Uni-kernel}
The selected TAG based architecture would be CHERI due to ease to acquiring of hardware 
for performance (i.e the ARM based CHERI morello). The official supported OS for 
the CHERI hardware is the CheriBSD \cite{CHERIBSD}. While doing experiments it 
would save a lot of time initially just porting the required kernel modules to 
RustyHermit.

\subsubsection{Hardware requirements}
Initially from the month of January 2023 they would tested locally on 
my personal of machine, but over the semester 
\begin{enumerate}
  \item 1 Cheri Morello machine 
  \item 2 Bare-metal x86 machines
  \item 2 FPGAs (For testing new architectures)
  \item 2 ARM based machines
  \item Rack space for setting up the machines 
\end{enumerate}

\subsubsection{The tasks are split into the following tags:}
\begin{enumerate}
  \item Porting 
  \item Setup
  \item Development
  \item Exploration 
  \item Technical discussion 
  \item Writing
  \item Testing
  \item Publishing
  \item Thesis
  \item Break
  \item Other
\end{enumerate}

% \subsection{More context}
% This section is split by a month by month planner to help keep tracks of tasks. 

\subsection{Year 2}
This section is split by a month by month planner to help keep tracks of tasks.
