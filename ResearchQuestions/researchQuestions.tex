\chapter{Research Questions}  %Title of the Research Questions

The following section talks about research questions: 

\begin{itemize}
    \item Which areas can Unikernels provide performance gains for TAG based architectures in comparison to the same implementation built using a monolithic OS? 
    \item Does using Enclaves inside Unikernels provide a isolation mechanism within Unikernels, maintain lightweightness characterestics, and 
    what would be the performance differnence between using Intel SGX and a open source implementation such as Timber V?
    \item Due to lesser depencies in Unikernels does that mean lesser TAG policies are required for the appication ? 
    \item Can Unikernel provide sufficient performance in such a way that a dedicated processor is not required for processing TAGS ?   
    \item Does Unikernels with TAGS provide a secure and elastic environment ? 

    % New ones 
    \item Using TAG standard memory with interleaving for speeding up types for dynamic languages and execution of parallelization on Mult-kernels with each core 
          running a Uni-kernel.
\end{itemize}
