\chapter{Conclusion}  %Title of the Conclusion
This report provides a proposal for the potential research 
activities for the following. The main focus would be 
the literature review section which covers most of important 
bits of the following report. Based on the surveyed implementation 
in the literature review which is for Uni-kernels, Multi-kernels 
and TAG based architecture. The mappings about the following 
for Uni-kernels the best implementation of among the uni-kernel 
implementations surveyed would Hermit-Core, For Multi-kernels 
Popcorn linux would be suitable choice and for TAG based architecture
CHERI would be a suitable. Referring to the literature review 
provides the exact reasons. The research timeline section helped
more create focused depth of the initial milestones for the research 
activities to be conducted.
